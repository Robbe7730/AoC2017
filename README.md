# Advent of code 2017
These are my solutions for AoC 2017, written in Python.

**Warning**: There may be some really shit code, but in my defence, I had pretty much zero Python experience when starting this. Also, I made most of these early in the morning, right after waking up, so my brain may not have been awake yet ;)
